thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",

mydict = thisdict.copy()
print(mydict)


# Another way to make a copy is to use the built-in function dict().

# Example
# Make a copy of a dictionary with the dict() function:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = dict(thisdict)
print(mydict)
